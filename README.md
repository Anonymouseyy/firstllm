# First LLM

Fun little project I made to experiment with GPTs and code one. Understand most of the concepts related with basic GPTs now.

## Using the project

Start with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Use `gpt-v1.ipynb` to work with hyperparameters and train them using the code block marked with `# Training`. Train and adjust model and hyperparameters however you want with a reasonably sized corpus named `x.txt` in the same directory.

Run `main.py` to speak with your new LLM :)

## Future Experiments

- Support bigger text corpuses
- Make it more efficient
